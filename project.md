Create a fullstack web application for managing tasks. Use a Spring Boot backend and a React frontend built with Vite. The backend should expose basic REST endpoints to create, read, update, and delete tasks. Each task has an ID, title, description, and a completed boolean. Use an in-memory data store like a list or map for simplicity.

The frontend should display a list of tasks, allow adding new tasks, editing existing ones, and deleting them. Use Axios to communicate with the backend. Keep the UI minimal with basic HTML and CSS. No authentication or database needed.
